# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the alumni society at Hack Club!

This is the official home of Hack Club Alumni Society, an association of Hack Clubbers who graduated from
high school and/or aged out of its YSWS grants and satellite events.

Most of the activities we do are reconnecting with fellow alums and helping the wider Hack Club community in
keeping it an inclusive and friendly space for everyone, alongside spreading the word about Hack Club's grants,
events and the fiscal sponsorship program to more people.

## Where to find us?

**In Hack Club Slack**: Most of us are at the `#alumni` channel, but there's also an invite-only channel for fellow alums.
Just run the featured workflow in the public channel or use the `/alumni onboard` command from Alumni Society Ops Bot
(coming soon 2026) to get started.

**Elsewhere**: You can find your favorite alumni people across the internet through the following:

* daily.dev: https://app.daily.dev/squads/hackclub
* BARQ! (for furries in HC Slack): https://barq.app/c/xVVmUo8 or search for Hack Club in groups
* Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hack_Club
* GitHub: https://github.com/hackclub-alumni (also https://git.hackclub.app/alumni)
* Zed Channel: https://zed.dev/channel/hackclub-25176 (see also the alumni subchannel)

## Imprint / Accountability

Administration of this GitHub / Hack Club Nest Forgejo namespace is primarily undertaken by the following
members of the society:

| Name and GitHub username | Slack user ID | Email/socials/website |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Andrei Jiroh Halili (`ajhalili2006`) | [`U07CAPBB9B5`](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U07CAPBB9B5) | <https://andreijiroh.dev/contact> |

While the society itself does not have its own HCB organization due to not being a Hack Club HQ-sanctioned project or
have the official blessing from the Community and Conduct team yet, to accept donations for its IRL activities, and then
some (not yet planned but being discussed), some alumni accept donations individually through GitHub Sponsors, and others,
so please check with them for details.

## Community guidelines

The [Hack Club Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct) still applies to this space, but please report misbehavior to one
of the Alumni Society admins listed in the `Imprint / Accountability` section first before emailing `conduct@hackclub.com`.
