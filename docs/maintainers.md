The role of the Alumni Society maintainers is to support Hack Club's alumni community.

They are responsible for serving the community to the best of their ability and availability, and for ensuring that the community remains a safe and welcoming space for all members.

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* Being the delegated Channel Managers for the `#alumni`, `#alums`, and [related channels](./slack-channels.md) on the Hack Club Slack workspace.
* Managing the Alumni Society's GitHub/Nest Forgejo/GitLab SaaS organization/namespace and its repositories/projects hosted under them.
  * This includes managing repository/project settings, access permissions, and overall organization/namespace structure.
  * They are the only organization admins/namespace owners to minimize security risks.
* Moderating community spaces and interactions outside Hack Club's official spaces.
* Organizing and facilitating events, meetups, and networking opportunities for alums, either virtually or in-person.
