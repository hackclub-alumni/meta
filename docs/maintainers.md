## Roles and Responsibilities

The role of the Alumni Society maintainers is to support Hack Club's alumni community.

They are responsible for serving the community to the best of their ability and availability, and for ensuring that the community remains a safe and welcoming space for all members.

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* Being the delegated Channel Managers for the `#alumni`, `#alums`, and [related channels](./slack-channels.md) on the Hack Club Slack workspace.
* Managing the Alumni Society's GitHub/Nest Forgejo/GitLab SaaS organization/namespace and its repositories/projects hosted under them.
  * This includes managing repository/project settings, access permissions, and overall organization/namespace structure.
  * They are the only organization admins/namespace owners to minimize security risks.
* Moderating community spaces and interactions outside Hack Club's official spaces.
* Organizing and facilitating events, meetups, and networking opportunities for alums, either virtually or in-person.

## Joining/leaving the Maintainers Team

You can reach out to the current maintainers via Slack DMs (or their contact details) as listed above or [in the meta issue tracker](./meta-issue-trackers.md) to express your interest. In some occassion, we may reach out to fellow alums and the wider community to invite them based on their contributions and engagement in the Hack Club community.

You can also leave the maintainers team at any time by notifying the other maintainers if you can't handle your responsibilities due to other commitments or maintainer burnout. We encourage open communication and transparency within the team to ensure smooth transitions.
