## Why I was rejected?

If you committed fraud (e.g. Hackatime banned) or abuse (e.g. breaking Nest's Acceptable Use Policy) or broke the hack Club Code of Conduct, you will not able to join the Alumni Society out of caution. You must appeal any sanctions with [the Code of Conduct Working Team] or wait until they expire (if they are
not permanent or serious enough).

Another might be you are still active within the Hack Club community in one way or another, be it in eligibility status for grants or even being a HQ/HCB staff. If this is you, don't worry, you will be admitted soon. Please do not re-submit the form as it will cause duplicates on our side.


## Instructions for alumni members

1. Once they submit their details to the Alumni Society Directory in Slack, look at their entry in the list. If you have questions about their submission, just DM there or write a email.
2. To approve and admit to the channel + user group, run `/alumni-society admit @mention-them-here`, replacing `@mention-them-here` by mentioning their Slack profile.
    - If happens to be submitted via the alternative form, run `/alumni-society admit altForm_ID`, replacing `ID` with the submission ID from Fillout API.
3. To deny, run `/alumni-society deny <mention or fillout submission ID>` and follow the prompts in the modal.
