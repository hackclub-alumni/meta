# Alumni Society Slack Channels

The Alumni Society can be found on the Hack Club Slack workspace, mainly in the `#alumni` (public) and [`#alums`][society-priv] (invite-only private) channels. This page documents each channel's purpose and how do they operate for alums and the wider community.

## Entrypoints

The main [`#alumni`][society-pub] channel is the main entrypoint for the community to connect with alums. This also serves as the meta channel for the Alumni Society itself (since having a seperate meta channel would be redundant).

The private [`#alums`][society-priv]] channel is the main space for alums. It is invite-only and primarily maintained by the [Society maintainers](./maintainers.md). Anyone can request to join by asking for a invite in the former or [going through the application process](./apply-for-membership.md).

## Announcements

Announcements related to the Alumni Society are posted in the [`#alumni-society-bulletin`][bulletin] mentioning the `@alumni-society` user group. This channel is read-only for alums to ensure important updates are not missed and only [the Society maintainers](./maintainers.md) (alongside the HQ/HCB team) can send them (everyone can still reply within threads).

There is also [`#alum-opportunities`][opportunities], a channel managed by Hack Club HQ staff, for any available opportunities (events, resources, etc.) specifically targeted at alums.

## Dev Work

Development activity related to the Alumni Society and its hosted projects on GitHub and GitLab.com are logged at [`#alumni-society-commits`][dev-activity]. Using Slack threads is encouraged on commenting specific commits or discussing issues and merge requests within the Slack.

## Miscellaneous

The [`#alumni-purgatory`][purgatory] channel exist mainly for testing purposes and is not intended for general use, initially as a joke channel for alums who still want to participat in YSWS programs even if they are technically overrage (see also [the original message][child-purgatory-context] for context).
